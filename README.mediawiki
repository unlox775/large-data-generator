==  How I assembled the Sample Dataset ==

# Connect to SequelPro (As root):
# Download Sample MySQL Database from:
#* http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx
# make import_addr table by uploading data from:
#* https://results.openaddresses.io/
#* I did the us_west-sa.zip
#* inside there I did us/or/portland_metro.csv
#* I used SequelPro to do the mass-import
# Patch to add a sequential Primary Key (after you have imported the data, usually works best):
<pre>
ALTER TABLE `import_addr` DROP `id`;
ALTER TABLE `import_addr` ADD `idx` INT(11) UNSIGNED  NOT NULL  AUTO_INCREMENT  PRIMARY KEY FIRST;
</pre>

=== Running the Script to populate dummy orders and customers ===

# Modify the DB connection line
# Each time it runs, it will insert:
## 786,254 customers (with random-skewed first/last name)
## A skewed random number of orders (most of the time 1, but up to 80-200 on a few customers)
## Order dates evenly distriubuted over the last 5 years
## Between 1 and 15 line items per order (skewed low)
## Choice of random product Skewed, so some products will have 80,000+ and others only < 100
# I ran it about 10 times

<pre>
php ./generate-cust-and-orders.php
</pre>
